# Introduction

This book is created to share the materials of the Ko√ß University Summer School Android Atelier.

Why did we decided to open an atelier about creating an Android application?

* You can build a real-life application at the end of this summer school.
* You can use the knowledge gained from the other course such as Advanced Programming or Machine Learning.
* You will also use the information from the art or design courses. Yes! Mobile programming design is one of the most important interaction design subject, since it is reachable to mass community.

Enjoy the course, join the programming cycles and discuss your application ideas with your friends!
